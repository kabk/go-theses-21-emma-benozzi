<h3>[As we keep walking our path deviates towards the entrance of a dense dark forest.<br>The old man says it reminds him of something, so we enter...]<br><br></h3>
      <p>For those who are not very familiar with the term Inquisition, it was coined way back, around 1231 in France, and it refers to a group of institutions within the Catholic Church whose aim was to combat heresy and religious dissent. Torture and violence were used by Inquisition to obtain confessions from heretics. Among all the nuances of Inquisitions — Medieval Inquisition, Spanish Inquisition, Roman Inquisition — in early modern Europe there was a debate between ‘Protestant Reformation’ and the ‘Catholic Counter-Reformation’ in which the two views were in constant conflict: if the Protestants viewed the Catholics as the terrifying Other, the Catholics firmly believed in their Holy Office as their fortress agains the spreading of blasphemies.<br><br>
          The belief in magic and witchcraft was widely spread in pre-christian Europe, and was reflected in the Germanic law. The persecutions of these beliefs by the Inquisition resulted in the revocation of these laws and the end of paganism and folk belief in witches, opening up an era of witch hunts and trials.<br>
The medieval Church distinguished between “white” and “black” magic. White magic was used to ward off storms, protect cattle, or ensure a good harvest by mixing up chants, incantations, and prayers. Black magic was considered malevolent, a type of sorcery that had to do with the Devil and cruel intentions.<br>
The Inquisition’s targets were witches that practiced black magic, their hunt became more prominent during the Renaissance era, perhaps fuelled by the Black Death, the Hundred Years War and the Little Ice Age<p1>{18}</p1>, all things for whose witches were often blamed. But by the Inquisitorial trials of the Benandanti it is clearly visible that there was more to the Church’s agenda. 
The Benandanti easily fall into what the Inquisition called ‘white magic’, yet they were relegated to the repressive archives<p1>{19}</p1> and slowly silenced.<br><br>
          Ginzburg’s book ‘The Night Battles’ starts right away with the analysis of a trial that happened in Cividale in 1575 between the Benandante Paolo Gasparutto and Inquisitor Don Bartolomeo Sgabarizza. These trials, aside from having great descriptive value of their knowledge, they serve as insight into the psychological dynamics between Benandante and Inquisitor, as the questions were growing insistently and the answers were becoming more suggested rather than authentic. <br>
According to the Benandanti, their night battles take place on an oneiric plane where their spirit would travel to the battlefield, leaving the body behind. <br>
This image matched in all the Benandanti’s early trials, but together with their gatherings to fight the witches it ended up being misunderstanding material, the more the Benandanti were opening up, the more the technique of the interrogation changed, becoming openly suggestive resulting into the making of the Benandanti’s confessions conform to the already existing model of the sabbath.<br> 
This probably induced the benandanti into finding a defence mechanism, a mask, behind which they would affirm to fight in the name of Christ and God, against those who carried on the Devil’s will.<br><br>
<p3>And he added: Our standard bearer carries a banner of white silk stuff, gilded, with a lion, while the banner of the witches is of red silk with four black devils, gilded.</p3><p1>{20}</p1><br><br>
          But this camouflaged attempt was not liked at all by the Inquisition. The agrarian cult, with a purpose in restoring the fertility of the earth, was not understood by the Inquisition, and the cult that acts on behalf of Christ was sharply rejected. Inevitably and unfortunately, the Church shifted towards a third direction: a cult that practiced witchcraft.<br><br>
          Up to 1620, the so far narrated features of this cult were recorded all around Friuli, in a seemingly stable way. 
In the timeframe of 50 years, the beliefs of the Benandanti, with their ambiguous features, are spread all around the region — an ensemble of beliefs and rituals transmitted mostly by mothers, who are the repositories of these traditions. The passage of this cultural heritage creates an emotional situation that turns those beliefs into a strong and resistant familiar bond. 
No Benandante knew that the upcoming phase of the Inquisitorial practice would actually <p2>pave the way for a subsequent period of swift, almost violent change.</p2><p1>{21}</p1><br>
In each Trial, the Inquisitors became more and more insistent, asking questions like <p2>Was there dancing, music, singing or eating in that field, were there beds, trees or other things? or whether when he went forth in the form of smoke, as he had said, did he first anoint himself with any sort of unguent or oil, or did he pronounce any words?</p2><p1>{22}</p1>, straining the benandanti with pressuring suppositions, that were — in the majority of the cases — hard to recant or even free from. The Inquisition keeps on suggesting the image of the Sabbath when questioning the Benandanti — somehow believing of predetermining their behaviour and answers — trying to adapt the testimonies of these people to the patterns of sorcery. <br>
As if this was not enough, the pressure from the dominant culture was not restricted to the Inquisitorial sphere. The mentality of the society around them was starting to change, and was accusing the Benandanti of the same devilish practice. The priests of the villages began to point the index finger against the Benandanti — rather than the witches — stripping them from any mystical power, viewing them as sources of mischief, trouble and scandals. 
Trapped in between these two fires, the Inquisition and the Society, the Benandanti can no longer hold their peace. A man named Marchetto, during an interrogation exclaims <p2>he (priest) lied about this, because we were created by God with free will, and no one could compel a man if this man did not want it</p2><p1>{23}</p1> — and like so, he had defined the breaking point between the dominant culture and the unreflective, spontaneous culture of the Benandanti. He merged free will together with the cryptic uncontrollable selfless need that demanded them to go fight on the nights of the Ember Days.<br><br>
          What sped up this process was also the inability of the Inquisition to comprehend and accept such cult, whose agricultural/agrarian definition was not taken into consideration at that moment in history. The benandanti tried many times to affirm their practice and their healing abilities, even by reinforcing their “christian mission”, but there has been a question mark on their heads since the very beginning, until the very moment in which a woman from Latisana, Maria Panzona, was arrested on charges of stealing napkins, shirts and other objects that were kept as charity in the Church of Santa Croce.<br>
           This woman was indeed a witch, and when the judge asked her to reveal her wicked acts, she reacts by stating:<br><br>
          <p3>I have never performed spells or charms, because I am a biandante, and benandanti are all opposed to witches and warlocks.</p3><p1>{24}</p1><br><br>
By the unjust appropriation of the cult’s identity, she fuels the desired long-term attempt of the Inquisition to absorb the image of the Benandnati into the one of Sorcery. It was Maria who recognised in the night battles of the Benandanti the image of the Devil’s Sabbath, spontaneously establishing the Inquisition’s agenda.<br><br>
          <p3>Once they avowed their participation in the sabbath, even if there remained indecision and hesitation in their attitude, the benandanti emerged, forced by the choices thrust upon them, from the ambiguous position which had made them both the objects of persecution by the inquisitors […] and of hatred by the witches. Little by little they had become what they had always been expected to be: witches.</p3><p1>{25}</p1><br><br>
          It was Ginzburg itself, in 1979, that asked Pope Giovanni Paolo II to consider the opening of the Archives to the public eye. It took them 20 years to open up the rooms with the older documents, but the Archives with documents from the 20th Century still stay closed. <br>
The Inquisition committed terrible crimes in the name of God, they persecuted, tortured, killed, burnt and destroyed anything or anyone that could have posed a threat to the Catholic Church. Their blind beliefs and violent acts are a pure representation of religious colonisation of knowledge and cultures.<br>
          In 1559 the Inquisition created the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a collection of books, subtracted from the public, that were considered heretical and against morality. The removal of these book from the public domain had consequences, not only the Church was colonising knowledge, but also history. <br>
All history has been colonized, and this means that we have always been told one aspect of it. Colonial history is arguably our whole history, and as Michael Taussig wrote, the colonial experience can be reduced to individual perspectives on terror and <p2>“the space of death”</p2><p1>{26}</p1> (a place of irrationality and learning), fragmented in that the perspective of one person is alienated from that of the Other. <br>
Death is used as an object for learning, therefore people do what they do because tempting desires appear to them. Desires such as power. Colonial history teaches people violence and rhetoric in order to acquire power and control. It doesn’t matter what methodologies and strategies are to be used. Therefore, there is a continuous need for an enemy throughout history, an enemy to justify the creation and establishment of Institutions. Without an enemy of the State like terrorism or conquerors, there is no reason for the State to exists; without the Devil, there is no Christianity.<br>Therefore I must agree with Taussig’s view on the definition of history: it is not a mere collection of different stories, but rather a game where the winners get to write the so-called dominant narrative.<br><br>
          Nowadays, in this now-more-than-ever hierarchical Society, it is us individuals that can define power.<br> 
Our actions, words and decisions, define now more than ever who gets the power. We tend to view the top of our society as absolute and incontestable — a separate organ that creates infallible strategies to apply to our lives — what instead we should do is doubt every power-state and draw our own conclusions whether this sources are trustable or not, whether what is discussed is valuable or not. 
If history has taught us something is that there has always been a quest for absolute power, since ancient times, and history teaches that the game plans behind these quests have improved in craftiness and deviousness, to an extent that made these strategies hidden to the public eye.<br><br>
