      <h1>– Opening –<br>Scene</h1>
      <h2>⛫</h2>
<h3>[At the sides of a rural road I see a young boy playing with his dog, 
and an odd old man, sitting on the ground, confused]<br><br></h3>
      <p>“Young man, what year do we find ourselves in?”<br>
	“We’re in 2020.”<br>
“Four hundred years have gone by…”<br>
	“Excuse me Sir, who are you?”<br>
“There should be no word to define those like us. 
So much has changed. Back in the old days we used to care for the little things, battling four times a year equipped with bundles of fennel we fought against dark witches attempting to protect the earth and to guarantee its fertility. Remember boy, fertile is the soil as well as our relationship with it. But we were not bound to last, young man. 
There has always been someone bigger than us, running on the path of power, promising a shiny destination to whoever followed.”<br>
	“And in the end, did you follow too?”<br>
“My people always chose to stay, not to follow any other path. Remember young man, sometimes when you chase something you don’t know how it looks like, it is hard to know when you will find it... <br>No, we did not follow. Instead we’ve been relegated to the Archives, repressed within our own skins. We have been sent to the afterlife, for an unknown reason, at least unknown to us.”<br>
	“But if you’re dead, how come you are still here?”<br>
“There are values that last longer than laws, symbols that took roots, rituals that are intrinsic in the human body, connections that are worth more than gold. Have you ever asked yourself why cults never really die?”<br>
	“Why did you not die?”<br>
“Patterns evolve throughout time and space; if the human nature is dualistic, its drive must be too. While someone strives for fame, power or wealth, someone else is looking for awareness, knowledge and balance. 
Certain kinds of rituals, traditions and beliefs are always recurring… How do the essence of spiritual tribes, cults and cultures that have been erased by great powers, survive throughout time?”<br></p>
