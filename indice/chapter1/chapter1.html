<h3>[With all these doubles in mind, the old man begins<br>
to tell his fascinating, holisting, far in time story]<br><br></h3>
      <p>The origin of fennel goes back to ancient times, before Greeks and Roman, as it was easily accessible throughout the Mediterranean Basin. The history of this plant is rich in symbolic values and healing properties. <br>
Mythologically, fennel was believed to be used by snakes, at the end of their shedding, to improve their eyesight by rubbing their face against it. It was firmly believed to be an antidote against poisons, toxic mushrooms, snakes and rabid dogs bites, and that if hung over doors it would ward off evil spirits or ghosts. In Shamanic practice it is used to foresee the darkness in life, as in hidden anger and pain, creeping deaths, diseases or poisonings, etc.<br>
It is undeniable that fennel has always been a plant overflowing with healing powers and beneficial values. 
For the Benandanti‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâalso according to to their connections with shamanism‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthis plant was a sacred tool against the darkness, a plant whose healing power is so strong that can defeat the diabolic evil.<br><br>
          <p3>Do you eat fennel and garlic? He replied: Yes, father we do, because they serve against the witches.</p3><p1>{11}</p1><br><br>
The Benandanti were an agrarian cult in the 16th and 17th Centuries. They aimed to live in harmony with nature and at the core of their interest and heart was to keep the harvests and the wild life safe from any form of cataclysm. In order to do so they followed specific fertility rites and night battles. The complexity and symbolism behind these rituals goes beyond modern comprehension.<p1>{12}</p1><br>
To be a Benandante was not a choice, it was a happening. In fact, all those that were born with a caul, were automatically members of the group, asked to actively participate at the age of 20, and freed at the age of 40, but many would choose to keep faith to the cause til death.<br><br>
          <p3>‚Ä¶and when they reach the age of twenty they are summoned by means of a drum the same as soldiers, and they are obliged to respond.</p3><p1>{13}</p1><br><br>
          The battling would recur four times in the cycle of one year, each year at night, on the Thursdays of the <p2>quattuor tempora</p2>, also known as the Ember Days, a cluster of four sets of three days in the ancient agrarian calendar, roughly around the transition from the old season into the new one. They would fight against the dark witches<p1>{14}</p1>, using bundles of fennel as weapons, while their enemies would battle with sorghum stalks. <br><br>
<p3>I am a benandante because I go with the others to fight four times a year, that is during the Ember Days, at night. We go forth in the service of Christ, and the witches of the devil; we fight each other.</p3><p1>{15}</p1><br><br>
          On the battlefield the Benandanti would fight, play, jump and ride different animals such as cats, rabbits and others. Several Benandanti were standing trial and their testimonies have been recorded and archived. One of their accounts stated that when the witches and the warlocks and the vagabonds return from their ‚Äúgames‚Äù, flushed and tired, they would go home to home looking for buckets, if they were to find clear water in them they would drink it, otherwise they would turn the basements upside down, the dark witches would urinate in them too.<br>
In Spring, they would thank for the rebirth of nature and the gift of light. In Summer, they would give thanks for the wheat crop. In Autumn, for the grape harvest. In Winter, for the olive crop. The result of their battle would define the three months following its happening. Whenever they would win a fight, in that season the crop would be abundant and the earth generous.
In case of defeat, famine would be the only prize. And like that, in four days they would fight for all the fruits of the earth, winning fertility. <br>
The descriptions in the testimonies of the Benandanti‚Äôs Trials, show a very specific fertility rite at the core of their gatherings, based on the agricultural year.<br><br>
          The Friulian landscape is full of heights‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâfrom the
crystal clear lakes surrounded by the sharp mountains
of the Alps to the vineyard lined green hills in the Colli
Orientali, from the brisk friendly rivers crossing stone
cities to the naked rock walls overhanging the sea that
can fade into fine sand or clash against boulders‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâand it
bears the markings of many wars. <br>
Now the realism of their night battles was never put into doubt by the Benandanti, but the landscape of their battles had a dream-like character, an oneiric space-time continuum. The portal of access to the night battles was their deepest sleep, in which their spirit would travel to different areas of the Region, leaving the body behind.<br><br>
          <p3>My spirit replied to him, and he added that it was his spirit that went forth, and if by chance while we are out someone should come with a light and look for a long time at the body, the spirit would never re-enter it until there was no one left around to see it that night; and if the body, seeming to be dead, should be buried, the spirit would have to wander around the world until the hour fixed for that body to die.</p3><p1>{16}</p1><br><br>
          This separation of body and soul is perceived as a dangerous deathly moment. Nonetheless, the spirit that leaves the body is seen as something undeniably tangible and real: an animal. Animals like cats, rabbits, wolfs, butterflies and mice are mentioned by the Benandanti in their trials when talking about their night travels. <br><br>
          Analogies with other past fertility rites are glaring ‚Äî rites such as those of a group of young people who impersonated respectively fertility gods and destruction demons in two ranks, one against the other, beating each other on the kidneys. From the outcome of the battle would magically depend the fate of the earth and the harvests. <br>
Or such as this other rite for the expulsion of the Witch, where an effigy of death would be beaten with sticks and driven away from the village. Later on we see this rites translating more and more into intangible matter, between oneiric and hallucinatory, on a deeper personal plane, but without ever falling into the fantasy genre. <br>
All of their manners and rites, from the night spirit travels to the battles for the earth, we must include the participation in processions for the dead ‚Äî which procured prophetic and visionary powers ‚Äî form a coherent pattern which immediately evokes the rites of the shamans. 
It is therefore undeniable the presence of shamanic traits in this Friulian cult. Shamanism, being an ancient spiritual form of elemental magic, involves a connection with both the natural and the spirit worlds, whose beliefs are those of honouring the elemental spirits (water, air, fire and earth).<br>
          Aside these rites, the Benandanti took proper physical care of the fields and the harvests. They were aware of the consequences of natural phenomena. I would even venture to say that they were well aware of weather conditions too. Besides, meteorology is an old thing. There are records of Babylonian clay tables with confident weather predictions from the location and look of the stars. Many civilisations used astronomy and astrology in their predictions, since meteorology was embedded in the notion of cosmos. So then why not think that the Benandanti had their own version of agrometeorology. <br>
After all, the Medieval Age was a stage of all sorts of minds and beliefs. The notions of what was and what had been were very present in the practices of physicians, alchemists, philosophers, etc. It was a time in which figures like Robert Fludd‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâalchemist physician‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwere still actively striving for a universal science: a combination of aesthetics, mysticism and rational sciences to an all-embracing system of knowledge.<br><br>
          <p3>[...] the Hermetic concept as above, so below, the perennial equivalence of macrocosm and microcosm.</p3><p1>{17}</p1><br><br>
          In the Inquisitorial records of the Benandanti‚Äôs Trials, within the reported facts, there is a key element of magic, not intended as sorcery but rather a form of enchantment. The beauty of this story, and the preciousness of this agricultural peasant society, lays in their truthful authentic connection to their land and ground.<br>
Their longing for the earth‚Äôs abundance and health portrays them as protectors of Nature. I believe their biggest source of power is their selfless approach towards the natural world and the basic need of keeping healthy what keeps you alive. I think these passionate stories about the earth can be a big source of inspiration for the people that nowadays, forgot its importance.
