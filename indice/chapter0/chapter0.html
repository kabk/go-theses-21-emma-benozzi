<h3>[As I look at the landscape I start to notice all of the oppositions,<br>the shadows and lights, the higher and lower, the movement and the stillness]<br><br></h3>
      <p>In Chapter Zero I’d like to introduce a key concept that will recurr throughout the whole thesis:<p2> dualism.</p2>
          Anselm Franke in his Much Trouble in the Transportation of Souls: the Sudden Disorganisation of Boundaries wrote:<br><br>
          <p3>The price paid by the moderns for cutting off their social ties to nature was that this nature, […] lost its meaning; what they gained was the belief in the universality of knowledge, and, above all, the freedom to manipulate and mobilize nature in ways unthinkable in pre-modern contexts.</p3><p1>{9}</p1><br><br>
He also talks about The Great Divide which is most likely a power that separates modern and pre-modern. 
On one side we find civilization (rationality, progress), on the other hand we find anything that’s primitive and archaic (colonized, things of the past).<br>
A very specific distinction between scientific rationality and spiritual beliefs. The Benandanti phenomenon would be considered ‘primitive’ by modernists, since it’s rooted in popular beliefs, and carries major traits of shamanism and spirituality, nonetheless it was considered as such also centuries ago by the Church. The Great Divide, this power that more than anything wants to impose duality over every thought, belonged to the Christian Church, the Church that promoted the Crusades, established the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, and burnt women at the stake.<br>
The result of this dualism was a psychological war, which continues to exist nowadays. 
Why whenever someone doesn’t belong to the same ‘school of thought’ as our own, this person is automatically labeled as different, stupid, insane, mad? Is anyone really allowed to think differently? I am not sure what the answer could be, and this extreme separation of thoughts makes me think of another quote from Anselm Franke that refers to Michel Foucault’s History of Madness, who tries to capture the earlier moment before intentional separation was created, generating opposition and contrast.<br><br>
          <p3>He attempts to return to the gesture of partition, […], the original grip by which reason confined unreason in order to wrest its secrets, its truth, away from it.</p3><p1>{10}</p1><br><br>
          In the same way Foucault approaches and explains the history of madness starting from where madness and reason were still united, where there was no conflict, I ask you reader, to navigate with no boundaries thought this story.<br>
Let your imagination bring you to places where you do not define nor judge creatures and their actions, but instead try to wind yourself into their essence and grasp their intentions.<br>
